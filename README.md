# GlyphDesign
 
A glyph is created using OpenGL to Visualize multidimensional data. The data is coded as: Radius of the tubes, length of the tubes, and color shade. The meshes are created at runtime based on the data using the geometric equations of torus and cone. A sample of the rendered glyph is shown below.
